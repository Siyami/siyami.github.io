        <h4>Name: The Great Wall</h4>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>
          The Great Wall (Chinese: 长城) is a 2016 Chinese fantasy action
          monster film directed by Zhang Yimou, with a screenplay by Carlo
          Bernard, Doug Miro and Tony Gilroy, from a story by Max Brooks, Edward
          Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. It is an American and Chinese
          co-production starring Matt Damon, Jing Tian, Pedro Pascal, Willem
          Dafoe, and Andy Lau. The Great Wall is Zhang's first English-language
          film.[7]

          Principal photography for the film began on March 30, 2015, in
          Qingdao, China, and it premiered in Beijing on December 6, 2016. It
          was released by China Film Group in China on December 16, 2016, and in
          the United States on February 17, 2017 by Universal Pictures. The film
          received mixed reviews from critics, who said it "sacrifices great
          story for great action."[8] Although it grossed $335 million
          worldwide, the film was still considered a box office bomb due to its
          high production and marketing costs, with losses as high as $75
          million.
